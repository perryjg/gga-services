Please see "Building a Custom Solution using the GGA Web Services.pdf" for a tutorial on using the GGA Web Services using Visual Studio and C#.
LegacyBillSummary.xsd and LegacyBillSummary.xslt are provided as support files for a bonus section at the end of the tutorial that will show you 
how you can create the same XML output that used to be provided by the General Assembly by using the Web Services.

UPDATED 8/1/2014:

Added documentation for using the new Web Api.  Please see "GGA WebServices Api Reference.pdf" for reference.  Added four HTML pages demonstrating use of Web Api using asynchronous JavaScript requests.  Please see:
webapi-example-1.htm = making a JSON request with the GET method of GetLegislationSearchResultsPaged
webapi-example-2.htm = making a JSON request with the POST method of GetLegislationSearchResultsPaged
webapi-example-1.htm = making a xML request with the POST method of GetLegislationSearchResultsPaged
webapi-example-1.htm = making a JSON request with the GET method of GetLegislationSearchResultsPaged, an extended example

NOTE: These HTML files will NOT work unless the included JavaScript file, jquery-2.1.1.js, exists in the same directory as the HTML files.
